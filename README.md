# Parser Heaven

[#Link](https://parser-heaven.netlify.app/)

**Parser Heaven** is a project parsing mathematical expressions. Maybe this is just reinventing the wheel for fun and personal education.

In this project I'm trying to implement following features.

## Mathematical

- Recognition
- Rendering
- Evaluation
- Optimization
- Determine equivalence of two given expressions
- Differentiation

## Boolean Algebra

- Recognizing boolean expressions
- Rendering boolean expressions
- Evaluates boolean expressions
- Determine equivalence of two given expressions
- Computing CNF and DNF

# Status

I'm trying to use TDD but I don't take that procedure strictly. Currently I'm working on writing test codes to assure everything to do right things.
